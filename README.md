# Nature's Delight - Islands of Interactivity with Iles and Tailwind CSS!

Jamstack (MPA-SSG) app for an fresh & organic fictional store implementing Islands Architecture, statically generated articles fetched from an external REST API source, a blog authored with markdown files, and everything styled with the power and beauty of Tailwind CSS. This app is built into a static site, and can be easily deployed to a CDN with excellent SEO.
